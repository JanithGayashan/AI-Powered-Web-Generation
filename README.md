# AI-Powered Website Generator Using LLM

This project is an **AI-driven website generator** that utilizes a **Large Language Model (LLM)** and **LangChain** to interact with users through a **chat interface**. It intelligently understands user requirements, identifies the website category, and generates a structured website accordingly.

## Features
- **Chat-Based Requirement Gathering:** Users provide their website requirements through an interactive chat system.

- **Automated Website Generation:** Dynamically creates a website structure based on user preferences.
- **Customizable & Extensible:** Supports various website types, including portfolios, blogs, business sites, and more.

## Workflow
1. Users interact with the AI through a chat interface to specify their needs.
2. The LLM analyzes the responses and classifies the website type.
3. A suitable website structure is generated based on user input.
4. The final output is a ready-to-use website template.
